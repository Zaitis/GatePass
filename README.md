# Parking Manager

Parking Manager is a web application that allows managing gate passes for vehicles to enter a parking. From experiences in a previous job, where managing parking spaces and issuing parking permits was time-consuming, this application was created to improve the process of managing parking spaces at a construction site. Unfortunately, it was never implemented in that company as I ended my collaboration earlier.

The application allows users to create an account, choose the company they belong to, and add cars. For each car, the user can request only one gate pass. The administrators manage the application, and they have access to an administrative panel where they can add companies and accept or reject gate pass requests.

Parking Manager can be used as a parking management application. Application its built-in REST API, it's also possible to extend it with a mobile application that would allow managing multiple parking lots at once.
